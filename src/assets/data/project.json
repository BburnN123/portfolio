            "description": "Coordinators are used in distributed systems to optimize resource distribution and maintain consistency. This is implemented with a leader election algorithm to elect new coordinators when the existing leader has failed. The Bully algorithm is a popular approach that re-elects the node with the highest identifier as the leader. However, this algorithm involves a lot of message passing to find the highest available identifier, which imposes heavy traffic. This project aims to improve the bully algorithm by reducing the number of messages exchanged between the nodes by dividing them into two groups to limit the number of nodes involved. By halving the nodes involved, the evaluation of the improved algorithm results in a 75% reduction in the number of messages sent, compared to the original bully algorithm.",

            "description": "<div>This project focuses on recommending appropriate and relevant case law through the use of text mining methods and similarity measures. The goal of this project is to show the connection between legal processes and the analysis of large amounts of text data, and perhaps increase productivity for both judges and legal persons when working with textual and legal issues. In order to overcome these problems, a formulation of a text clustering approach enables the grouping of related documents based on the user input.</div><br/><div>Within the raw document, there are lots of special characters as well as numbers that would hinder the process in the later stage. Hence, the document would remove any words that are less than three such as “to”,”be” and any numeric that could be found in the document. In addition, special characters like “.” or  “ ‘ ”  are removed from the document.</div><br/><div>Next, we did a comparison using the “CountVectorizer” and “TF-IDF Vectorizer” to preprocess the document. The conclusion was to use “TF-IDF Vectorizer”as it provides us with a more statistical measure to reflect how important the words are in a document. <a href=”https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c” target=”_blank”>PCA</a> was done to further reduce the number of attributes while preserving as much information as possible.K-Means and Cosine Similarity was done to check if the document is able to group or return any similar documents to the user. Data visualization was done to check if any further tuning of the parameter is required. </div><br/><div>Lastly, instead of searching for a keyword that matches the input, the recommender system is able to process the keyword and return the document with the highest word similarity. It is also able to process and return the cluster of the input query. WordCloud is used to display the significance of the word. The larger the word, the more significant the word is for the respective document. </div>",

The mobile application was further integrated with the beacons with further testing. Some consideration would be the duration for the mobile application to recieve its signal as well as the succession rate of detecting the beacons . Other tests that were done was to check if there were multiple beacons within the area and how to overcome it.</div> <br/><div>After testing, we realised that there was always a delay of 1-3 seconds before the mobile application is able to do warn the user. This have prove the unreliability of the beacons as we required a real time tracking. Another disadvantage would be that the user has to on its bluetooth in order to receive the signal from the beacons. Another approach that was considered was the usage of GPS to alert the user from the danger. Due to the limit resources and time, the confidence level of using the GPS was low as there was not enough testing being done.</div>",
