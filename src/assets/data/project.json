            "description": "Coordinators are used in distributed systems to optimize resource distribution and maintain consistency. This is implemented with a leader election algorithm to elect new coordinators when the existing leader has failed. The Bully algorithm is a popular approach that re-elects the node with the highest identifier as the leader. However, this algorithm involves a lot of message passing to find the highest available identifier, which imposes heavy traffic. This project aims to improve the bully algorithm by reducing the number of messages exchanged between the nodes by dividing them into two groups to limit the number of nodes involved. By halving the nodes involved, the evaluation of the improved algorithm results in a 75% reduction in the number of messages sent, compared to the original bully algorithm.",

            "description": "The number of accidents involving jaywalking pedestrians rose by 21% in the first half of 2017 in Singapore with about 30% of the cases involving the older adults according to the Traffic Police. Aging is a global trend, the declined perceptual, cognitive function and motor ability in older adults may affect their performance with road crossing and increase the crash risk. Perception and attention are important factors for deciding the direction and speed on the road. In a complex environment when deciding to cross a two-way traffic road, older adults may face problems in determining the direction of the traffic and making the timely decision to cross the road safely. Older pedestrians often resort to jaywalking because of physical and psychological barriers. Decreased lower limb muscle strength and osteoarthritis made these older adults cannot walk very far/fast or walked up or down an overhead bridge and may become road safety worries. Also, evidence has shown that the effects of medical conditions that result in cognitive impairment on pedestrian performance and crash risk.",
